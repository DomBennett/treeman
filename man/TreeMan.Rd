\title{S4 class for representing phylogenetic trees as a list of nodes.}
\details{
A \code{TreeMan} object holds a list of nodes. The idea of the \code{TreeMan}
class is to make adding and removing nodes as similar as possible to adding
and removing elements in a list. Note that internal nodes and tips are
both considered nodes. Trees can be unrooted and polytomous.


Each node within the \code{TreeMan} \code{ndlist} contains the following data slots:
\itemize{
   \item \code{id}: character string for the node ID
   \item \code{txnym}: name of taxonomic clade (optional)
   \item \code{spn}: length of the preceding branch
   \item \code{prid}: IDs of the preceding nodes to the root
   \item \code{ptid}: IDs of the immediately connecting nodes
   \item \code{kids}: descending tip IDs
   \item \code{pd}: phylogenetic diversity represented by node
   \item \code{prdst}: pre distance(distance to root if rooted or
   most distal tip if unrooted)
}
These data slots are updated whenever a node is modified, added or removed.

See below in 'Examples' for these methods in use.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{ndlist}}{list of nodes}

\item{\code{nds}}{vector of node ids that are internal nodes}

\item{\code{nnds}}{numeric of number of internal nodes in tree}

\item{\code{tips}}{vector of node ids that are tips}

\item{\code{ntips}}{numeric of number of internal nodes in tree}

\item{\code{all}}{vector of all node ids}

\item{\code{nall}}{numeric of number of all nodes in tree}

\item{\code{age}}{numeric of max root to tip distance}

\item{\code{pd}}{numeric of total branch length of tree}

\item{\code{ext}}{vector of node ids of all tips with 0 age}

\item{\code{exc}}{vector of node ids of all tips with age > 0}

\item{\code{wspn}}{logical, do nodes have spans}

\item{\code{ultr}}{logical, do all tips end at 0}

\item{\code{ply}}{logical, is tree bifurcating}

\item{\code{tol}}{numeric of tolerance for determining extant}

\item{\code{root}}{character of node id of root, if no root then empty character}
}}
\examples{
library(treeman)
# Generate random tree
tree <- randTree(10)
# Print to get basic stats
print(tree)
# Currently available methods
tree['tips']  # return all tips IDs
tree['nds']  # return all internal node IDs
tree['ntips']  # count all tips
tree['nnds']  # count all internal nodes
tree['root']  # identify root node
tree[['t1']]  # return t1 node object
tree['pd']  # return phylogenetic diversity
tree['age']  # return age of tree
tree['ultr']  # is ultrametric?
tree['ply']  # is polytomous?
tree['ext']  # return all extant tip IDs
tree['exc']  # return all extinct tip IDs
tree <- setTol(tree, 10)  # reset tolerance, default 1e-8
# now tol is higher more tips will be classed as extant
tree['ext']
# Because all nodes are lists with metadata we can readily
#  get specific information on nodes of interest
nd <- tree[['n2']]
print(nd)
# And then use the same syntax for the tree
nd['age']  # .... nkids, pd, etc.
