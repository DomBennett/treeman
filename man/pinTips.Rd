\title{Pin tips to a tree}
\usage{
pinTips(tree, tids, lngs, ends)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{\code{TreeMan} object}

\item{tids}{new tip ids}

\item{lngs}{list of vectors of the lineages of each tid}

\item{ends}{end time points for each tid}
}
\description{
Returns a tree with new tips added based on given lineages and time points
}
\details{
User must provide a vector of new tip IDs, a list of the ranked lineages
for these IDs (in ascending order) and a vector of end time points for each new ID
(0s for extant tips). The function expects the given tree to be taxonomically informed;
the \code{txnym} slot for every node should have a taxonomic label. The function takes
the lineage and tries to randomly add the new tip at the lowest point in the taxonomic rank
before the end time point.
