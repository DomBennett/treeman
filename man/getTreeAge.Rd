}
\description{
Returns age, numeric, of tree
}
\details{
This can also be achieved with \code{tree['age']} but will
only work if the the tree has been updated with \code{updateTree()}.
For faster computation, especially within function that perform multiple
tree manipulations where the whole tree doesn't need updating, use this function.
